-SYN22-5 cell abundances in optical instruments were underestimated due to cytometer sensor saturation. Cell abundances in optical instruments for SYN22-5 were thus estimated by multiplying the optical cell concentrations by the SYN22-4 ratio of optical cell concentrations to culture cell concentrations.
